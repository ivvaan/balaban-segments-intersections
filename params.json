Balaban, An optimal algorithm for finding segments intersections, \r\nProceedings of the eleventh annual symposium on Computational geometry, \r\np.211-219, June 05-07, 1995, Vancouver, British Columbia,Canada.\r\n\r\nBoth suboptimal and optimal algorithms are implemented.\r\nAlso parallel version of suboptimal algorithm is given. \r\nSuboptimal algorithm called \"fast\" in the implementation because it is faster than optimal one in most practical cases. \r\nFor comparison trivial algorithm, simple sweep line and Bentley & Ottmann algorithms are presented too.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to show practical behavior of the algorithms. \r\nNo any degenerate cases processing is implemented. \r\nSo only segments in common situation are processed correctly. \r\nFor example all segment ends must have different x coordinates.\r\n\r\nProject was compiles under MS VisualStudio 2008-2010. Hopefully it can be compiled in any other C++ enviroment.\r\n","google":"UA-61716652-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
